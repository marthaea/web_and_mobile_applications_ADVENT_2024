//difference between var, let and const
// var is the oldest way to declare variables in Javascript
//while let is a nwewer way to declare variables introduced in 2015 by ECMAScript
//const is another newer way of declaring variables in javascript although it cannot be updated or redeclared

//what happens if you try tob reasign varibles declared with let or const
//with let, there are no issues, the value is reassigned
//with const, you automatically get a 'Type error: assignment to constant variable'

//var x = 10;
//let y = 5;
//const z = 3;

// x = 20;
// y = 15;
//z = 7;
//console.log(x, y, z);
//The code behaves this way because the const variable has been reassigned
